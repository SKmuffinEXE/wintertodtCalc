# wintertodtCalc

This is a simple program that calculate the chances of getting the pet at wintertodt in OSRS.  Just change the backend numbers to your numbers.  If you're unsure of how many
attempts you've tried to get a pet, just double your kill count under the "runs" portion.

It should then show you the chance of getting a pet, and you can put in how many rewards you get off of each kill.  For quick runs, we have an add 2 and add 3 button, but for 
longer attempts you can manually type in how many rewards you got each kill.
